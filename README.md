# NetworkAnalysis_RiskPerception

This repository provides R code used to perform the network analyses presented in the paper below and demonstrates how to apply these methods.

The study explores how public perceptions of multiple hazards are interconnected and how they evolve over time in Italy and Sweden. The analysis is based on data from three nationally representative surveys (n = 12,476) conducted in August 2020, November 2020, and August 2021.

For simplicity, the provided code analyzes only the perceived likelihood of hazards in Italy during the first time period (August 2020). However, variables for the remaining analyses are included, should you wish to explore them further.
